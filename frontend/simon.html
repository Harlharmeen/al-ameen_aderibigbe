      <h4>🎮 How to Play the Simon Game</h4>
      <p>Welcome to the Simon Memory Game! Test your memory and see how many levels you can complete.</p>
      
      <h4>🧠 Objective</h4>
      <p>Repeat the sequence of flashing colors for as long as you can. Each round, the game adds a new color to the sequence. Your goal is to remember and repeat the growing pattern.</p>
      
      <h4>🕹️ How to Start:</h4>
      <p>On desktop: Press any key. <br>
        On mobile: Tap anywhere on the screen.</p>
      
      
      
      <h4>🎯 How to Play:</h4>
      <ul>
      <li>Watch carefully: A color will flash — this is the first in the sequence.</li>
      <li>Click/Tap the color to repeat it.</li>
      <li>The game will then flash the full sequence again with an added color.</li>
      <li>Repeat the full pattern** in order each time.</li>
      <li>Keep going — the sequence gets longer each round.</li>
     </ul>
      
      
      
       <h4>❌ Game Over:</h4>
      
       <p>
        If you tap the wrong color, the game ends. <br>
       The screen will flash and say: "Game Over". <br>
       Press any key or tap the screen again to restart.
       </p>
      
      
      
       <h4>📝 Tips:</h4>
      
       <p>
        Play with sound on — each color has a unique tone. <br>
       Focus and try to visualize or say the pattern aloud.
