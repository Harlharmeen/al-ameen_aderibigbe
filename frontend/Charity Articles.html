        <div>
            
            <p>One of the distinctive traits of our beloved prophet Ibrahim (PBUH) that earned him the title <em>Khalilullah</em> (The Intimate Friend of Allah) as mentioned in Surah An-Nisa (4:125), was his unwavering generosity.</p>
            <p>And as muslim youth striving to elevate their status in submission to the will of Allah, is this noble act of giving (charity) not worthy of emulating if we, too, seek to be raised in rank by Allah (SWT)?</p>
            <p>This article explores the essence of charity (sadaqah), its significance in individuals' lives across self-development, its power to contribute to communal well-being, and, most importantly, why it is an essential form of submission (worship) to the will of Allah.</p>
            
            <h2> Basic Understanding of Charity (Sadaqah)</h2>
            <h3> What Does Charity Mean?</h3>
            <p>Charity, <em>sadaqah</em> in the Arabic language, means righteousness in simple terms and is also a derivative of the Arabic root word <em>Sidq</em> which translates to <strong>truthfulness or sincerity</strong>, in English. Arising a safe claim that sadaqah is an act of righteousness done with sincerity. </p>
            
            <p>Extensively, it is a voluntary act of giving to help others and seek Allah's pleasure. It extends across sharing money, kindness, advice, material things, or at least a ‘smiling face to your brother’ (<em>Tirmidhi 1956</em> ).</p>
            <h3>Giving Charity in Your Own Way</h3>
            <p>Sadaqah has a boundless and minimum restriction to which it can be given, as emphasized by the hadith of the prophet (PBUH) that says, <em>“Every act of goodness is charity”</em> (<em>Sahih Muslim 1005</em>).</p>
            <p>This made the condition of sadaqah giving easy, justifying all audience of this article are capable of giving charity in their unique ways.</p>
            
            <p>For example, medical experts can offer free medical treatment to those who cannot afford basic healthcare. Senior colleagues can provide free tutorials to their junior ones on campus, and social activists can raise awareness about the pains of people in distant localities of society to the central government.</p>
            
            <h3> The Admonished Way to Give Charity</h3>
            <p>As much as Sadaqah has almost no strict rule binding it, Islam as a complete religion with moderation ethics addresses the manner of giving charity to reap the best of this investment.</p>
            <p>The Prophet (PBUH) described the best giver as one <strong>"who practices charity so secretly that his left-hand does not know what his right hand has given"</strong> (<em>Sahih al-Bukhari 1423</em>).</p>
            
            <p>Advantageously, this approach protects the dignity of the recipient and keeps the giver's intentions immune from being corrupted by the nullifier of pure intention (Riya’- show-off).</p>
            <p>Evidence from the Quran further admonishes us to be on the safer side, <em>"If you disclose your Sadaqah (charity), it is well; but if you conceal them and give them to the poor, it is better for you" (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:271)</em></p>
            
            <h3> Forms of Charity </h3>
            <ul>
            
            <li><p><strong>Sadaqah Jariyah (Continuous Charity)</strong> are charity that continues to benefit others long after it is given, ensuring continuous rewards for the giver even after his death. </p>
            <p>Examples include building a well, funding schools, or donating books to a library. The hadith of the Prophet (PBUH) said, “Ongoing charity is part of the three deeds of men that never comes to an end even after his demise“  (Sahih Muslim 1631)</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Sadaqah Wajibah</strong> is an obligated charity under specific circumstances, such as Sadaqah al-Fitr and Kaffarah (charity given to expiate sins).</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Sadaqah Nafilah</strong> is a voluntary charity given purely out of goodwill and the desire to earn Allah’s pleasure. It has no set amount or conditions and can take many forms, such as helping a neighbor, feeding the poor, or supporting a community project.</p></li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2> Why Charity is the Best Investment</h2>
            <h3> Makes You a Favoured Individual of Allah</h3>
            <p><em>"Who is it that will lend to Allah a goodly loan so that He may multiply it for him many times over?" (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:245).</em> This Ayat is evidence that charity is partly the fare paid in the journey of becoming a favored individual in the sight of Allah. </p>
            <p>This act of giving demonstrates submission to His doctrine by obeying His commands to help others alleviate their deprivations, which in turn yields individual immense rewards and an increase in ranking. </p>
            
            <h3> Three-blade Sword to Fight in Life, Grave, and Hereafter</h3>
            <p>Charity can be likened metaphorically to a three-blade sword that is useful for fighting for ease <em>in life, the grave, and the hereafter</em>.</p>
            <h4>In Life</h4>
            <p>Charity brings ease and blessings to one’s life as Allah has promised to multiply the wealth and rewards of those who give generously, as stated in the Quran: <em>"The example of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah is like a seed of grain that grows seven ears, in every ear a hundred grains" (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:261.</em>)</p>
            <h4>In the Grave</h4>
            <p>Acts of charity that continue to benefit others, such as Sadaqah <em>Jariyah,</em> keep providing rewards for the giver even after death. These ongoing rewards illuminate the grave and make the transition to the hereafter more peaceful, and serve as a protective guard against the terror of the grave.</p>
            <h4>In the Hereafter</h4>
            <p>On the Day of Judgment, charity earns a person the privilege of being under the shade of Allah’s throne, a rare and enviable reward. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, <em>“The believer’s shade on the Day of Resurrection will be his charity” (Tirmidhi 604)</em></p>
            
            <h2> Essence of Charity as Personal Benefits</h2>
            <h3> Path to Allah’s Blessing Acknowledgment</h3>
            <p>The act of giving (sadaqah) reinforces the understanding that wealth and resources are entrusted by Allah, and using them to help others aligns with His cherished indoctrination of giving.</p>
            <p>Sharing what one has, is an acknowledgement of Allah's provision and a means to express thankfulness gratitude invites more blessings, as the Quran has stated: <em>"If you are grateful, I will surely increase you [in favor]" (Surah Ibrahim 14:7).</em> </p>
            <h3> Guide to Empathy</h3>
            <p>In an individual’s exploration of assisting others, he/she gains the better understanding of the challenges faced by the ‘less privileged’ and deeply connect with their struggles.</p>
            <p>Assuming their shoes and also knowing it is Allah’s mercy that exonerates one from such fates heightens the empathy synergy in the person and in turn makes them compassionate and care more for humanity. The resulting heightened empathetic mindset nurtures a heart that is kind, considerate, and attuned to the needs of others <em>(Empathy)</em>. </p>
            <h3> Course to a Sense of Purpose</h3>
            <p>Giving charity (Sadaqah) transforms wealth and resources into tools for positive change, giving the giver a meaningful role in the contribution to the betterment of her society. This sense of impactful contribution (purpose) not only brings fulfillment but also strengthens faith, as the giver sees their contributions making a tangible difference in the lives of others. </p>
            
            <p>Through constant charity, one becomes an agent of hope and goodness, a constant recipient of genuine prayers from the ‘vulnerable’ people, and becomes a node in extinguishing world hell (poverty, unhappiness, ill-health, etc.).</p>
            
            <h2> The Essence of Charity as Community Benefits</h2>
            <h3> Foster of Brotherhood (Ummah) Unity</h3>
            <p>When people come together to address the needs of the “less privileged”, it creates an atmosphere of solidarity and shared purpose. The unity among these individuals is rooted in generosity which strengthens social ties and contributes to a harmonious and cooperative society. </p>
            <h3> Bridging Privilege Disparity</h3>
            <p>Charity(sadaqah) ensures that basic needs such as food, smile, clothing, peace, and shelter are being assisted for those in need. This not only alleviates suffering but also prevents the less privileged from having hatred and treacherous plots against the privileged in society. </p>
            <p>Societal collaboration in easing the pain of the ‘less privileged’ class through charity improves the quality of life of the majority in a given society, and this fosters a more just and balanced society.</p>
            <h2> Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Charity is to be seen as more than just an obligation; it is a powerful act of faith, a means to personal growth, and community uplift. It can be exhibited in many forms ranging from monetary donations, acts of kindness, knowledge-sharing, and even a simple smile.</p>
            <p>For Muslim youth, charity should not be seen as a burden but as a means to elevate their status with Allah, cultivate empathy, strengthen their faith, and give life a deeper purpose. After all, it is an act that benefits not only the recipient but also the giver, bringing blessings in this life, protection in the grave, and immense rewards in the Hereafter. </p>
            <h3> Call to Action</h3>
            <p>Now is the time to make a difference! Whether through Sadaqah Jariyah (ongoing charity), or any other form of charity explained in the main body of the article above. And lest we forget, charity is done with humility and sincerity, seeking Allah’s pleasure rather than worldly recognition.</p>
